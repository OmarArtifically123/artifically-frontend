## 2. RUTHLESS CLARITY IN VALUE PROPOSITION

### 5-Second Test (Visitor Understanding)
**Standard:** Any visitor can answer these in 5 seconds:

1. **What is this?** → AI automation marketplace with 200+ pre-built automations
2. **Who is it for?** → Business owners, operations teams, enterprises (SME to Fortune 500)
3. **What problem does it solve?** → Eliminates manual work in customer service, finance, sales, operations
4. **What's the primary action?** → Browse automations OR Book demo (clear path for each persona)
5. **Why trust this?** → Real customer logos, SOC 2/GDPR badges, uptime stats visible above fold

###Hero Messaging Formula
```
[Eyebrow] Clear category positioning
[Headline] Concrete outcome + timeframe (not buzzwords)
[Subheadline] Specificity (numbers, examples, proof points)
[CTAs] Two clear paths: Low friction (browse/trial) + High intent (demo)
[Trust signals] Immediately visible: logos, badges, stats
```

**Bad Example (Current):**
```
Eyebrow: "The World's Premier Enterprise AI Marketplace"
Headline: "Enterprise AI Automation Meets Operational Excellence"
→ FAILS: Buzzwords, no concrete value, unclear what this actually is
```

**World-Class Example:**
```
Eyebrow: "AI Automation Marketplace for Enterprise Operations"
Headline: "Deploy 200+ Pre-Built AI Automations in Hours, Not Months"
Subheadline: "Automate customer service, financial close, sales follow-up, and operations workflows. Zero custom code. Enterprise security. Used by 500+ companies."
CTA 1: "Browse 200+ Automations" → Marketplace
CTA 2: "Book Enterprise Demo" → Sales
Trust: [Customer logos] [SOC 2 ✓] [GDPR ✓] [99.98% Uptime]
```
