Their 40-person operations team manually reviewed shipping manifests, generated customs forms, and cross-checked compliance requirements—taking an average of 3 hours per shipment.\n\nThe manual process created systemic issues: shipments often missed departure windows, requiring expensive expedited shipping. Errors in customs documentation led to border delays, costing $2,500-$8,000 per incident in demurrage fees. During peak seasons (Q4), the backlog reached 5-7 days, causing customer escalations and contract penalties.\n\nTheir existing RPA solution handled only simple document templates and broke frequently when regulatory requirements changed.

The models achieved 99.2% accuracy on data extraction, with automatic confidence scoring to flag uncertain fields for human review.\n\n**Phase 2: Compliance Automation (Weeks 4-6)**\nIntegrated Northwind's compliance database (maintained by their legal team) with real-time regulatory updates from customs authorities. The system automatically selects appropriate forms, populates required fields, and validates against current regulations. When rules change, the system adapts within hours instead of requiring code changes.\n\n**Phase 3: Workflow Orchestration (Weeks 7-8)**\nBuilt end-to-end automation from shipment booking to customs clearance.
