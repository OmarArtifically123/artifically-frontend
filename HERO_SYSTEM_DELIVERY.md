## How to Use

### Quick Start - Existing Code
No changes needed! The existing hero system continues to work perfectly.

### Enhanced Version - Add Glassmorphism
```tsx
import HeroEnhanced, { HeroPremiumButton, HeroPremiumCard } from "@/components/landing/HeroEnhanced";

<HeroEnhanced>
  <YourExistingHeroSection />
  <HeroPremiumCard>
    <h2>Enterprise AI Automation</h2>
    <HeroPremiumButton>Get Started</HeroPremiumButton>
  </HeroPremiumCard>
</HeroEnhanced>
```

### Advanced - React Three Fiber
```tsx
import HeroBackgroundV2 from "@/components/landing/HeroBackgroundV2";

<HeroBackgroundV2 variant="default" />
```

### Use Glassmorphism Styles
```tsx
import { useGlassmorphismStyle, HeroPremiumButton, HeroPremiumCard } from "@/components/landing/HeroEnhanced";

const style = useGlassmorphismStyle("elevated");
<div style={style}>Premium content</div>
```
