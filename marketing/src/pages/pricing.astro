      "Workspaces are billed monthly based on active seats and automation executions. Annual contracts unlock dedicated capacity planning support and a discount on seats.",

    question: "Can I deploy in my own region?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Enterprise plans can run in isolated regions, including on-premise or VPC deployments with private networking and hardware security modules.",

    question: "What support is included?",

      "Growth plans receive 24-hour response times and a named customer success manager. Enterprise plans include 24/7 on-call coverage and quarterly architecture reviews.",
